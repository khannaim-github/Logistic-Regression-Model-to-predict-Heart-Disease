ML Model for Heart-Disease Prediction using LogisticRegression

What is Logistic Regression? 

Logistic regression is a statistical method used for predicting the probability of a categorical dependent variable (often binary, like yes/no or 0/1) based on one or more independent variables.


How does it work?

Unlike linear regression, which predicts a continuous value, logistic regression predicts the probability of an event occurring.

It uses a logistic function (or sigmoid function) to map the output to a value between 0 and 1.

0: Represents the probability of the event not occurring.
1: Represents the probability of the event occurring.


Key points:

Classification: Primarily used for classification problems.
Probability: Outputs probabilities, which can be converted into class predictions using a threshold (e.g., 0.5).
Sigmoid function: Maps linear combinations of features to probabilities.
Applications: Widely used in various fields, including finance, healthcare, marketing, and more.

Here, we are going create a Logistic regression Model ( Classification ) that can predict whether or not a person has presence of heart disease based on physical features of that person (age,sex, cholesterol, etc...)
